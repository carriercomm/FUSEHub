*Browse that Repo in TextMate*

So I want to hook up an extension for chrome that will let you click one button to mount the repo onto your filesystem

I also want to be able to just mount the filesystem and create my own directories for users and repos, for example I create the user defunkt and the filesystem gets all his repos for me so I can browse too.

A lot of these features are now in, as is a google chrome extension to add mount buttons to repo pages, and user pages

Coming soon: binaries, released extensions, an a UI!
