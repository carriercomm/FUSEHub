*Browse that Repo in TextMate*

So I want to hook up an extension for chrome that will let you click one button to mount the repo onto your filesystem

I also want to be able to just mount the filesystem and create my own directories for users and repos, for example I create the user defunkt and the filesystem gets all his repos for me so I can browse too.

It's getting there
